h2. Known issues

h3. [BUG] Bus Error

This is really an issue with EventMachine. If you are using this on a machine that has MacPorts, you'll need to make sure that you build both ruby and eventmachine linked against the openssl in /opt/local, not /usr/local.

h3. warning: peer certificate won't be verified in this SSL session

A bug in net/http. Noisy, but harmless.
